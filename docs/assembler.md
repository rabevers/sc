# MSP430 Assembler programming

## Introduction
Starting with 20 year old knowledge about assembler programming I'm attempting to program a servo controller with a MSP430.
I've chosen assembler because it allows a better control over the timing of various pieces of code. Also Assembler code is often smaller than other languages such as C.

This document is primarily for myself to keep track of what i'm doing and to create a reference for when I need to look something up i've already done.
